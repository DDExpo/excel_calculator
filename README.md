# Excel-Calculator
 Excel Calculator is a Python program designed to calculate clean earnings from financial data stored in Excel files.
 It provides a convenient way to process financial data and determine the net profit after deducting expenses and taxes.

## Why?
So i can calculate my wage 100x faster (not joking, like i need to spend from three to five hours to calculate my wage for a month)

## Usage
 For example, we have an upload of sales data from KaspiBank as an Excel file, so we can calculate expenses by simply
 entering purchase prices for each unique card once and then simply click a button and calculate income. As shown below
